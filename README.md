## English Summary

### The gut microbiota
The human body hosts countless microorganisms, with a significant portion residing in the digestive system. The bacteria and other microorganisms in our gut, such as fungi and viruses, are collectively referred to as the gut microbiota. A rich and diverse gut microbiota can contribute to good health in its host, for example, by suppressing harmful bacteria. Additionally, these bacteria assist with tasks such as nutrient digestion and training the immune system. The microorganisms constantly influence each other and their human host. Microbes adapt to the specific conditions of their host, with factors such as diet, lifestyle, hormonal regulation, and the immune system playing a role. As a result, the composition of the microbiota frequently changes, for instance, after foreign travel or during antibiotic treatment. Despite these adjustments, it is hoped that the microbiota does not lose its functions, ensuring, among other things, that the integrity of the intestinal wall remains intact.

The significant role of the gut microbiota in our health has led to extensive research into this ecosystem. Fecal samples are often collected to study the composition and diversity of gut bacteria using DNA analysis techniques such as 16S rRNA sequencing. However, technical factors, such as sample quality, the DNA extraction method used, and the choice of primers, can influence which species are detected and how they are represented in the results. Additionally, incomplete databases, the vast microbial diversity, the dynamic nature of the microbiota, and the limited knowledge about many species make these analyses particularly challenging. The resulting data are complex and require advanced methods for accurate interpretation.

The dynamics and stability of microbial communities, in relation to health and disease, can be studied using techniques such as network analyses and time series models. Network analyses map which bacteria frequently coexist within an ecosystem, providing clues about how microbes might influence and interact with each other. Time series models help track changes in microbial communities over time and uncover patterns. Studying the microbiota is challenging because it cannot be directly observed in the body, and often only a limited number of samples are available. A small number of samples, both in terms of participants and measurement points, complicates the identification of robust associations and makes it difficult to distinguish between individual variation and general patterns.

In the project *Ecology meets human health*, we first examined the reliability of network analyses and alternative methods for mapping relationships between microbes. Next, we combined clinical, microbiological, and ecological concepts to better understand how microbial dynamics are linked to intestinal diseases, specifically Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, as well as the success of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a treatment. In this context, we investigated the ecological factors that influence the gut microbiota and the functioning of this complex ecosystem.

### Ecological structure in the gut microbiota
The gut ecosystem consists of numerous species whose presence depends on variations in the environment and functional needs, such as breaking down food, producing vitamins, or combating pathogens. Additionally, interactions often occur between bacteria, which can have positive (beneficial) or negative (detrimental) effects on the species involved. Understanding these interactions is crucial for grasping ecological processes and changes within the microbiota. Correlation methods are often used to map these networks.

In **Chapter 2**, we investigated the reliability of correlation methods for inferring interaction networks using generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) models to simulate bacterial communities. We showed that measurement noise and sampling variation can obscure true ecological interactions, and that correlations do not distinguish between interaction types. Therefore, laboratory validation remains necessary to confirm relationships. While gLV modeling provides valuable insights, real data remain indispensable. Longitudinal studies, which track microbial communities over time, provide a stronger foundation for understanding community stability and change, although such datasets are rare due to practical constraints.

In **Chapter 3**, we analyzed longitudinal microbiota data using wavelet clustering, a method suitable for non-stationary ecological data. By studying near-daily stool samples from two individuals over one year, we showed that wavelet clustering can capture dynamic patterns in microbial communities that traditional correlations miss. These findings highlight how analytical methods strongly influence interpretations of microbiota structure and dynamics.

### Gut microbiota and Inflammatory Bowel Disease
The interaction between humans and the microbiota has evolved over billions of years, forming a complex symbiosis. Disruptions in this balance (dysbiosis) are linked to diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. In **Chapters 4 to 6**, we studied how bacterial dysbiosis relates to disease progression in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

Using quantile regression, we showed that relationships between specific bacterial families and disease activity differ among patients, underscoring disease heterogeneity. Associations between bacterial families and clinical biomarkers (such as fecal calprotectin) revealed that some bacteria are negatively correlated with inflammation, providing potential targets for microbiota-based monitoring or therapy.

### Ecological determinants of FMT treatment success
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) aims to restore a healthy microbiota by introducing donor communities. However, treatment outcomes vary widely. In **Chapters 5 and 6**, we investigated microbial determinants of FMT success in ulcerative colitis.

Our analyses revealed that successful treatment is associated with specific microbial families (Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae) and lower abundances of Prevotellaceae. Interestingly, patients who responded well to treatment maintained a higher number of host-associated bacterial species, while those who did not benefit showed a transient increase in donor species that later declined. These results suggest that successful FMT depends on the host microbiota’s ecological resilience — its ability to accommodate donor species without losing its functional core.

### In conclusion
Multiple environmental and lifestyle factors shape the human gut microbiota. By integrating ecological theory with microbiome research, this thesis highlights that microbial systems are dynamic, adaptive, and context-dependent. Understanding these ecological principles can inform more effective microbiota-targeted interventions, moving beyond a “one-size-fits-all” approach. Personalized strategies, such as donor–recipient matching based on ecological compatibility, may improve treatment outcomes.  
Ultimately, viewing the gut microbiota as a resilient ecological system, rather than merely a collection of microbes, provides a foundation for more sustainable and personalized health strategies.
